# 3D, step 3: Creating them (progress)

Terrain above terrain's third step (D280 (3); the spec is ROADMAP.md, "Terrain above terrain" → "3. Creating them"):
Erode, the Block tool, and the brushes, forces and recorded strokes on runs.

## Delivers 3: the brushes, forces and recorded strokes on runs (built 2026-10-14)

On `feature/3d-strokes-on-runs`, core only. Nothing changes on a map without caves or overhangs.

**The rule, per brush, on a tile that is not one plain run from z = 0** (an imported map's cave roof, overhang or
floating ground). Every brush shapes the tile's top run and nothing below it; the lowest a roof's top may go is one
layer above its underside (`terrain/runs.ts` `topFloor`, `topFloors`), so the roof keeps a layer, the cave's air and
floor stay exactly, and no tile gains or loses a run.
- **Raise** grows the top run upward (to its target, or softly), up to the editor's ceiling as on any tile.
- **Lower** cuts the top run down, to its target or softly, stopping one layer above the underside.
- **Flatten** moves the top run toward its level both ways, the same stop below.
- **Smooth** and **Naturalize** read the roof's top as the tile's surface, as for any tile, and keep the same stop
  (`BrushStroke`'s `low` takes the floor; Naturalize's weathering holds it after its repairs, `weather.ts` `floor`).
- A riding piece (D249) is never levelled below a roof's stop.
- The build's pit-and-spike pass leaves a roof's top as the strokes leave it, and the features never reshape one.

**The support rule.** Nothing an edit does may leave ground the game would drop. After every step on a map with
caves or overhangs (`MapSession.apply` and `applyAll`: a stroke, a force's result, a removed object that held ground)
the session compares the blocks the game would delete before and after (`terrain/support.ts` `newFalls`); any new
one and the step is taken back as if never taken, refused with one line: "12 blocks of ground would fall: nothing
would hold them up" (`fallsReason`). Ground an imported map already loses is not the edit's. Only lowering can
drop ground (Raise adds blocks standing on the roof): cutting the cliff that holds a ledge, or thinning a roof whose
upper layers carried its span. The page's stroke can show that ground while it is painted: `StrokePreview.falls()`
on the `TerrainState` the session hands it (`floor`, `masks`, `stackTops`), the same cells the session refuses.

**The forces** stay on heightfield ground (their Rust and TypeScript read surfaces): on a map with caves they leave
the caves' tiles as they are, as before (the planner keeps them, `forceResult`'s check refuses them), and a result
that would drop ground is refused by the same rule. Moving them onto roofs waits for Erode.

**Terrain as built:** `ColumnTerrain.withSurface(heights)` now reshapes each tile's top run to the surface
(plain tiles exactly as before; on the rest, everything below the top run kept), so the session's `terrain`, the
export's voxels, the support pass and `columns` (the mesher's voxels, now as they stand) all follow the strokes. A
surface equal to the base's gives the base, voxel for voxel: an unedited import exports byte for byte.

**Recorded strokes** replay onto the same runs: the floors come from the stored base, which never changes (D336).
Projects saved before this replay strokes over roofs differently (D475: no old-project compatibility).

**For the page and the renderer (not this branch's files):** the worker's `ViewUpdate` carries `columns` when an
edit reshaped a roof's top; the renderer must take them (the mesher draws those tiles from their columns, not from
`heights`). The page may show `StrokePreview.falls()` in red while a stroke is painted. Lines in the PR.

**Checked:**
- On a map without caves, byte for byte: `tools/stroke-hashes.ts` (480 strokes, every brush, sizes ½ to 9, soft,
  targets, squares and areas, on four generated maps and the same maps imported) and `tools/map-hashes.ts` (the 84
  maps), on dev and on the branch: identical.
- `tests/contract/strokesOnRuns.test.ts` (CI, a hand-made cave map): Raise grows a roof, Lower stops at its lowest
  layer, cutting a ledge's cliff is refused with the count the page's stroke shows, the page paints what the build
  makes, random strokes keep every run under a roof and drop nothing, undo gives each state's exact runs, a full
  build equals the incremental one, the project replays onto the same runs, an unedited cave map exports its voxels.
- `tests/contract/strokesOnRunsOfficial.test.ts` (local only, skipped on CI): the same on Hollows, Canyon and
  Pillars, 30 strokes each, refusals included; an unedited import exports byte for byte.
